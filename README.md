# A Simple Implementation of Prolog in Python

This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> Lab of _"Introduce to AI"_ course. The algorithm can run fast on YES/NO queries but it may run really slow on some complicated queries. I'll fix it later when I have some time. Or may be you can help me with that <3

# How to use

First, you need to create an input file (`input_file`), it containes your facts and rules.

After that, create a query file (`query_file`), it has all of your queries.

Finally, Run this command:

```sh
python prolog.py [--input <input_file>] [--query <query_file>] [--output <output_file>]

Where:
	-i <input_file>, --input <input_file>
	Path to input file

	-q <query_file>, --query <query_file>
	Path to query file

	-o <output_file>, --output <output_file>
	Output file name.
```

Thank you and good luck.
